<h1>Text Editor with Spell Check.</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hey devs, this project is all about Text-editor named as <b>DevPad</b> build purely in C language. I will not use any graphics library and will try to make it closer to CLI and also try to not complicate things. It should do all the basic necessary things that an ordianry text editor(like: Notepad) do.
<hr/>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Follwing are the features i am looking to implement in our text-editor.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a file.</li>
    <li>Read a file.</li>
    <li>Add data to a file.</li>
    <li>Spell Check</li>
</ul>
<p>The spell check is a key feature of DevPad.
This Spell Checker and the way it made easy for user make it different from most of the editors present in the market.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Making a text editor is not a big deal but applying a Spell Check is the thing currently i am looking for.
<span>For applying a spell check i have to find an efficient way of doing this. </span>
I have some ideas in my mind and trying them step-by-step.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Design should be neat and clean and easy to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>It shoul have a Menu Screen</li>
<li>Will bind some keys for doing the tasks. Eg: Press r for reading a file.</li>
<li>After pressing the desired key your file should open.</li>
<li>Spell check will work like it will not change your riginal file, it will makes a new file and highlight the misspelled words.</li>
<li>Also we will maintain a log file to keep check how many words the file contains and how many words are misspelled so the user can improve for next time.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
<p>By this activity i will get to know one more step deeper towards C. Also it boosts my self motivation to work as individual and know my strengths and weakness, as improving weakness is always the best thing.
</p>
<p>Technical skill that will be improved are like:
<li>Heandling and Managing File in C.</li>
<li>Creating and including custom header Files in C.</li>
<li>Get to know more about Data structures and Algorithms.</li>
<li>Some cool features which can be performed using linux and C combination.</li></p>
<hr/>
<h2>Further features to add:</h2>
<p>I am reading about <b>Encoding-Decoding</b> and algorithms from some time, thinking to implement in the text editor so the user who want to encode/decode his file should not use any 3rd party app for it. </p>
